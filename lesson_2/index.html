                    trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge has flirted
                    briefly with a number of careers ranging from a police officer to an anti-violence activist.

                    Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9, 1983) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family
                    and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.<br> She was named after
                    a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who
                    exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's
                    surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental
                    involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding
                    and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by
                    those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
                    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of
                    Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who
                    she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealousy from time to time and will do
                    whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary.
                    Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
